# Topo-Blazor

Topo is a helper application to assist scout leaders in getting meaningful reports out of the Scouts Australia Terrain application.

Topo now runs as a Blazor Webassembly app in the browser and doesn't need to be installed.

The project can be found at https://github.com/NomisNostab/Topo-Blazor.

To run Topo just go to https://nomisnostab.github.io/Topo-Blazor/ and it will download and start, be patient while it downloads.

All new development will be done against the Topo-Blazor project, not this one.

## Installation
### Browser
To run Topo just go to https://nomisnostab.github.io/Topo-Blazor/ and it will download and start, be patient while it downloads.
